    "## A final note about regular expressions\n",
    "Sometimes you will need to match something more complex than just a particular word or phrase in your output file.  Sometimes you will need to match a particular word, but only if it is found at the beginning of a line.  Or perhaps you will need to match a particular pattern of data, like a capital letter followed by a number, but you won't know the exact letter and number you are looking for.  These types of matching situations are handled with something called *regular expressions* which is accessed through the python module `re`.  While using regular expressions is outside the scope of this tutorial, they are very useful and you might want to learn more about them in the future.  A tutorial can be found at [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter7/). A great test site for regex is [here](https://regex101.com/)."
